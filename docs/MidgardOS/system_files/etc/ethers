# ethers         This file maps Ethernet addresses to IP addresses.
#                It is used by the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
#                to resolve IP addresses to Ethernet addresses.
# 
# Format:
# Ethernet_address  IP_address
#
# Each entry consists of an Ethernet (MAC) address followed by
# the corresponding IP address, separated by whitespace.
# Comments start with a '#' character and continue to the end of the line.
# Blank lines are ignored.
#
# See the ethers(5) manual page for details.
# Example entries:
# 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E   192.168.1.1
# 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5F   192.168.1.2
# FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF   192.168.1.255
#
# Note: Ensure that the Ethernet addresses are in the correct format
#       (six pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by colons) in uppercase
#       hexadecimal.
