# netgroup          This file describes the netgroups available on the system
#                   and is used by the NIS (Network Information Service).
#                   It can also be used locally by applications that
#                   support netgroups.
# Format:
#
# netgroup_name (host1,domain1,user1) (host2,domain2,user2) ...
# Each entry consists of a netgroup name followed by one or more
# tuples enclosed in parentheses. Each tuple contains three fields:
# host, domain, and user. A field can be left empty to indicate a wildcard
# that matches any value.
# Comments start with a '#' character and continue to the end of the line.
# Blank lines are ignored.
#
# See the netgroup(5) manual page for details.
#
# Example entries:
# mynetgroup (host1,,user1) (host2,,user2) (,,user3)
# anothergroup (host3,,) (,,user4)
